A spreadsheet model for production of methane and degradation of organic matter in various manure slurry barn and external slurry tank systems. Various abatement technologies can be applied. 

The input paramters are animal type, animal feed, digestibility, excretion of faeces and urine, degradable organisk matter (can be converted into biogas), hydraulic retention time based on flushing (emtying) intervals and amount of residual slurry (as inoculum of methanogens), barn and floor type, slurry temperature, ratio between CH4 and CO2 etc.

Methane production is estimated from the Arrhenius-model (Petersen et al., 2016). 

The orange cells are input cells and the whithe cells with orange coloured numbers are result cells.

The model is developed by Anders Peter S. Adamsen, Michael J. Hansen, Peter Kai and Frederik Rask Dalby.
